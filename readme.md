# Social App - MEAN stack ðŸ‘‹ (Updating...)

## Demo : https://sleepy-caverns-33833.herokuapp.com/ ðŸŽ§ 
Use free database and free hosting so it is very slow

## Features ðŸ”­ 
- ðŸ”­ Create post with image
- ðŸŒ± Like, comment, share post
- ðŸ‘¯ Show user profile
- ðŸ¥… Edit profile
- âš¡ Change avatar
- .....

## ðŸ”­ How I implement 

### Operation with post ðŸ“• 
- ðŸŒ± Create *subject* ```update```, which emit a function that change the posts[]
- ðŸŒ± Use ```scan``` method to create a stream, contain ```posts[]``` after updated by this function

### Limit amount of posts each time loaded.ðŸ“• 
- ðŸŒ± Create an ```observable1$``` emit a value when scroll to bottom of page
- ðŸŒ± Create an ```observable2$``` to load post
- ðŸŒ± Use ```exhaustMap``` from ```RxJS```, so that when I scroll to bottom, it emits a value. After that, it will subscribe observable that load posts. If user keep scrolling to bottom, the value emit from ```observable1$``` will be skipped, don't create a lot request to server.
